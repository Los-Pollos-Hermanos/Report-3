      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
         <li>Rodrigo: In charge of validation error messages, some problems with the code especially with those related to the date, but tackled in Kyle's office hours. After that, I started working on boostrap for the design phase.</li>
         <li>Sergio: While creating the events-detail section, I encountered a lot of problems with the coding. This part that was assigned to me had a lot of programming, and  I was required to do some research as well as get some help to be able to finish it. After creating the events-detail section, I was assigned to do the redirection. This part was easier due to the fact that I only needed to link the event detail section to the user once the same user created a valid event.</li>
         <li>Miguel: In charge of event details, only possible with additional help!! "Let the force be with you"</li>

      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Rodrigo: Start working on the design for some extra points, and in the first project change (donations).</li>
         <li>Sergio: On the next sprint I will focus on the layout of the webpage. I will try to make the visuals more aesthetic and nicer to the eyes of the users. Hopefully this change will make the webpage more attractive and appealing.</li>
         <li>Miguel: Hackathon and free pizza!!!!</li>
